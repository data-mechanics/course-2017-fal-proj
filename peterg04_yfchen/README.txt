For our idea we decided to tackle the problem of happy hours being banned in Massachusetts. For the purposes of our project we will mainly be focusing on the Boston area. We wanted to find out the most when and where it would be safest and most efficient to have restaurants host happy hours. 

The five datasets we decided to use were:
College and Universities of the Boston Area
Public Schools 
Waze Jam Data
Police Stations 
Restaurant Inspection Data

Using the schools datasets we were able to find an aggregate amount of colleges and public schools within the same zipcode. Zipcodes with significantly more colleges or no public schools would be potential hot zones for happy hours as it would mean less kids/families and more young adults in the area. 

With police and restaurants were were able to find locations of restaurants that do sell alcohol and are within a certain proximity to police stations. Our assumption for the time being is that if anything were to happen it would be good to have law enforcement to help civilians. 

Finally, our waze jam data will be used to check congestion of traffic during different times of the day.The less busy the road the more likely we will choose that place.
