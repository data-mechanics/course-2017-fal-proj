**Can Boston handle Inclement Weather?**

Boston is a dynamic city, not only with respect to the people and cultures that melt within it, but also with its weather conditions! You often hear people saying: "If you don’t like the weather in Boston, wait five minutes.” Boston recently showed up on the "Top 10 cities with most unpredictable weather in USA". Severe weather conditions, though a natural occurence, pose serious threat to the infrastructure and well being of the city. This project aims at providing some insights about this dynamic equation by analyzing the occurences of events that happen in and around Boston during inclement weather: Safety issues, damages to property and life, Food conditions, crime statistics and so on. Doing an in-depth analysis of what level of severity is impacting each of the above areas will provide a data driven baseline for city officials to make informed descisions to reduce those number of incidents, thus helping the city as a whole.
